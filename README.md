## Hi, I'm Vinay Lanka! 

I'm pursuing my Masters in Robotics as a Graduate Student at the University of Maryland, College Park. 

Previously,
- Robotics Engineer at Newspace Research and Technologies.
- R&D Engineer (Robotics and IoT) @ Neoflux (Part of DMG Group).

Electronics and Communication Engineering Undergraduate from VIT Vellore.

I like to dabble in Web Development, Embedded Systems, CAD Design, 3D printing, and IoT by doing interdisciplinary projects, check out some of the projects below!
I also work on hardware projects (Woodworking, Aluminium profiling) and love tinkering in a workshop. 
I generally just like to make and build things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development for Robotics, Control of Robotic Systems, and Robot Modelling and Kinematics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a web-based ROS project!
